TechDegree Unit 2 Project - Pagination

Purpose:
- Utilize progressive enhancement to create a manageable list of students.
- All JS must be unobtrusive: all buttons and search features should be added by code and not directly into the HTML.
- Code should be dynamic and work with any given number of students.

Goals:
- Display only 10 students at a time.
- Create appropriate number of pages for any given number of students.
- Add event listeners to the page buttons and navigate to the appropriate student set (ie - page 2 displays students 11-20).

Extra objectives:
- Create a search bar.
- Create functionality: when used, it should filter through the students and display the appropriate matching results.
  - Add a keyup event to allow auto-search.
  - Ensure search results are paginated as well.
  - Write to page if no results are found.
